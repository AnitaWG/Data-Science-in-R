# Structure of a Data Analysis
##  steps in a data analysis
Define the question   
Define the ideal data set   
Determine what data you can access   
Obtain the data   
Clean the data   
Exploratory data analysis   
Statistical prediction/modeling   
Interpret results   
Challenge results   
Synthesize/ write up results   
Create reporducible code   

## Exploratory data analysis   
```{r}
library(kernlab)
data(spam)
set.seed(3435)
trainIndicator = rbinom( 4601, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
table(trainIndicator)
trainSpam = spam[ trainIndicator ==1, ]
testSpam = spam[ trainIndicator == 0, ]
# summarys, missing data, exploratory plots, clusting...
head(trainSpam)
plot( trainSpam$capitalAve ~ trainSpam$type )
plot( log10(trainSpam$capitalAve +1) ~ trainSpam$type )
plot( log10(trainSpam[,1:4]+1))
hCluster = hclust( dist(t(trainSpam[, 1:57])))
plot(hCluster)
# statistical prediction / modeling
